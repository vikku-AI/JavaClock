# Java CLock

This is basic implementation using Java Swing. We make Clock time.

We create A one window frame with the help Jframe.

Here we created a GUI layout using gridLayout.

We have Impleneted a clock using two method one is using without thread another is using thread.

At last we call our MyWindow class through main method. 

Thanks.
